# EECS-498-DL-Computer-Vision
My solutions to Michigan's public course [EECS 498.008: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/), taught by Justin Johnson (Fall 2019). Lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r).

# About Me
I am a 3rd year at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em!) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Math. I'm the CTO of [Clips](https://www.clipsai.com/) (checkout the link for more information!) which heavily utilizes machine learning, specifically deep learning and natural language processing. I've decided to complete this course (as well as other public courses EECS498/CS231N: Deep Learning for Computer Vision and CS224N: Deep Learning with Natural Language Processing) to gain the required knowledge in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to be able to properly build the models we're using at Clips. 

You can find out more about me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-smidt/). If you have any questions about my solutions, learning machine learning, or just want connect, feel free to follow me and reach out on LinkedIn. I can be a little slow to respond depending my current responsiblities but I can assure you I will respond! I hope you enjoy this course as much as I have and that my solutions are helpful :)

Last thing, big thank you to Michigan for making these lectures and course material publically available! I've really enjoyed this course (Justin Johnson is a great professor) and it's been immensely helpful in learning deep learning!

## Lecture Notes

My personal notes of the lecture videos are too large to store on GitHub so you can find them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HR9ji_F64mLXg3i-ZzgLo7budN3ESA65/view?usp=sharing) on my Google Drive (Note that this file is likely too large to view in Google Drive so you'll have to use a third party service such as Lumin or download it to your computer).

## Problem Sets
The problem set assignments (instructions) can be found [here](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS229-ML-Autumn-2018/tree/main/Problem-Sets). All coding assignments are programmed using Google Colab in PyTorch. 

All of my solutions are located in Solutions. I've also linked them here for
