# EECS-498-DL-Computer-Vision
My solutions to Michigan's public course [EECS 498.008: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/), taught by Justin Johnson (Fall 2019). Lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r).

Note: this course is taught by Justin Johnson, who used to teach CS 231N: Deep Learning for Computer Vision at Stanford. I was going to complete CS 231N but Michigan's version (this one) had more assignments available and is two years newer than the public version of CS 231N (2019 vs. 2017). 

# About Me
I am a 3rd year at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em!) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Math. I'm the CTO of [Clips](https://www.clipsai.com/) (checkout the link for more information!) which heavily utilizes machine learning, specifically deep learning and natural language processing. I've decided to complete this course (as well as other public courses [CS229: Machine Learning](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS229-ML-Autumn-2018) and [CS224N: Deep Learning with Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS224N-Deep-Learning-NLP) to gain the required knowledge in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to be able to properly build the models we're using at Clips. 

You can find out more about me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-smidt/). If you have any questions about my solutions, learning machine learning, or just want connect, feel free to follow me and reach out on LinkedIn. I can be a little slow to respond depending my current responsiblities but I can assure you I will respond! I hope you enjoy this course as much as I have and that my solutions are helpful :)

Last thing, big thank you to Michigan for making these lectures and course material publically available! I've really enjoyed this course (Justin Johnson is a great professor) and it's been immensely helpful in learning deep learning!

## Lecture Notes

Course slides and lecture notes can be found [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/schedule.html) by clicking on the top link (slides) or the bottom link (notes) for a given lecture. Note that lecture 1 does not have any lecture notes. 

## Assignments
Assignment instructions are embedded in the provided notebook for each assignment. Along with each notebook is a python script that does the heavy lifting for the notebook. There's also an accompanying pdf I wrote using LaTeX explaining the mathematics, my thought process, overarching concepts, etc. So, to be clear, assignment instructions and solutions are in the same notebook (in this repo) which contains a python script as well (same name), and a pdf (same name). There are a total of 6 assignments (with sub-assignments and subparts), each of which are a directory (1st Assignment = "A1", 2nd = "A2", etc.). 

If you want to see the assignments without my code (eg. you want to do it yourself!), they can be found at the [course website](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/)

All coding assignments are programmed using Google Colab and PyTorch.
